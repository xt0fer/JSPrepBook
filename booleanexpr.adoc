== Boolean Expressions

When you are coding, you often have to make a choice about what to do next based on some kind of condition. Something like `is the gas tank empty?` or `are we moving faster than 100mph?` In real life, these are considered to be YES or NO kinds of questions. So when if the tank is empty, the question results in a TRUE condition. If there is some gas in the tank, then the question's result is FALSE, "no, it is NOT empty."

And while this may seem super simple to you, and it is, it is also very powerful when used in a program. 

=== Comparison Operators

[source, JavaScript]
----
let x = 5;
----

is x less than 7??

is x greater than or equal to 3??

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description |Example
|== |Equal to |x == 5
|=== |Equal value and type |x === '5'
|!= |Not equal to |x != 55
|!= |Not equal to value and type |x != '5'
|> |Greater than |x > 1
|< |Less than |x < 10
|>= |Greater than or equal to |x >= 5
|<= |Less than or equal to |x \<= 5
|===


=== Logical Operators

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Operator |Description |
|&& |Logical AND |playerOneStatus == 'alive' && spacecraft.hasAir()
|\|\| |Logical OR |room.Temp > 70 || room.Temp < 75
|===


Both sides need to be Boolean expressions


=== Mini Lab

* Create 2 variables to use for comparison 
* Use at least two comparison operators in JS
* Just put them in a console.log(2 > 1)
