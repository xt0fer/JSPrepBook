Let's look at a series of problems that you can solve to get a feel for what we're looking for on the Zip Code admissions assessment.

== Algebra Exercises

Computing is often programming a computer to math.
By solving these problems, you'll get a feel for the kind of algebra problems we'd like to be able to solve.

Fell free to use the https://code.zipcode.rocks REPL to work these problems out. 
(You can also just work them out in your head or on paper)

As with many kinds of programming tasks, these problems can be solved a large number of ways.

=== Y equals ?

----
Given the following formula,
 
y = (5 * x) + 100

what is y, if x = 3?
----

For each of these problems, you need to compute the value of *y*. 
In each case the value of *x* is different, and so is the formula you need to compute.

For this first one, if *x equals 3*, you would first multiple *5* times *3*, and then add 100 to it.
So a correct answer is *15 + 100* or *115*.

Each of these below are computed in pretty much the same way.

----
Given the following formula,
 
y = (4 * x) - 5

what is y, if x = 5?
----

----
Given the following formula,
 
y = (6 * x) - 7

what is y, if x = 2?
----

----
Given the following formula,
 
y = (15 / x) * 8

what is y, if x = 5?
----

=== Velocities

Velocity is often thought of as *speed*. It's common to drive at 40 or 45 miles per hour.
That speed is a *velocity*.
*Acceleration*, you may remember, is the change in velocity.

If a car is moving at an initial velocity V, and accelerates at rate of A for a set time 
period of T, the formula to determine it final velocity S is: 

****
S = V + A*T
****

----
What is S if (V = 10), (A = 4), (T = 3)?

What is S if (V = 0), (A = 5), (T = 20)?

What is S if (V = 17), (A = 2), (T = 14)?
----

You substitute each variable (V, A and T) in turn into the formula and compute the result.

=== F of X or F(x)

Sometimes you will see a formula expressed as a function which takes one argument, *x*. 
This is an algebraic function, not a Javascript function.

****
F(x) = 3x + 4
****

My point is, this is just another way of describing a simple computation.
Some might say that F(x) (which is pronounced _F of x_), is the same as *y* was
in the problems above.

****
y = 3x + 4
****

*Y* ended up being the answer to the computation. 
So is _F of x_ is also the answer to the computation.
Don't overthink this, *y* and *f of x* are just two ways of saying the same thing.


=== F of (x, y)

Well, so if _F of x_ is the result of a function, _F of x and y_ is also the result of a function.
But in this case, the functions takes two arguments *x* and *y*.

Given the following function using x and y: 

**** 
F(x, y) = 2x + y -27
****

And then if _F(1, 2) = -23_, well, how did we get that result?

The idea is that you think it trhough like this

----
given F(1, 2),
we assign x=1 and y=2.
we substitute these two variables and compute the result.
(2 * x) + y - 27
(2 * 1) + 2 - 27
2 + 2 - 27
= 23
----

Using that as a *pattern*, what is:

----
f(20, 8) = ?
f(6, 25) = ?
f(5, 2) = ?
f(0, 0) = ?
----

=== Complete the answer

For this problem, you need to figure out the correct answer to the last expression. 
----
dog + fish = 25
dog + bird = 35
bird + fish = 30
----

If the above expressions are true, what is the answer to this?

----
dog + bird + fish = ?
----

== JavaScript Coding

=== Area of a Triangle
  
image::TriangleArea.png[Triangle]

The area of a triangle is calculated using the following function:

****
Area = (h*b)/2
****

where Area represents the area, h represents the height perpendicular to the length of its base, b.

----
if h = 6 and b = 4,
(6 * 4) is 24
24 / 2 is 12
= 12
----

----
What is Area, if h = 4 and b = 5 ?
What is Area, if h = 2 and b = 6 ?
----

What do you need to do to this function to make it use the triangle equation?

[source]
----
function triangleArea(h, b) {
    area = 0;
    return area
}

console.log(triangleArea(4,5));
console.log(triangleArea(2,6));
----

=== Javascript Math

If asked to write a function that 
Complete the function to calculate multiplication of two input values. 4 x 4 should print 16.

----
function square(x) {
    return x;
}
----

Write a simple function that returns the remainder (modulus) of the following equation:  118 % 31

----
function foo() {
    return 
}
----

Using Arithmetic Operators, return the product of 789 x 123.
Complete the function to calculate the square of an input value. Remember that the square of a number is the result of multiplying that number times itself.
=== Variables (10)

Create a variable with the value 1024 and return the variable.

=== Functions (15)
Make a function that:
Return the string value "Zip Code" from the given function.
and more...

Using the length method, return the length of the string "ZipCodeRocks" using the given function.
 
Example 1
input: "hello".length
output: 5
 
Example 2
input: "Delaware"
output: 8

=== Arrays (30)

Complete the function below to swap two elements in an array and return the result. Your function should take three arguments: An array and two integers. The integers are the indexes of the two elements in the array you should swap.
 
Example 1:
 
Input:
[7,4,9,3,6,2], 4, 2
 
Output:
[7,4,6,3,9,2],

=== First and Last (50)

Given a string, create a new string made up of its last two letters, reversed and separated by a space.
 
Example
Given the word 'bat', return 't a'.

lastLetters has the following parameter(s):
    string word:  a string to process
 
Returns:
    string: a string of two space-separated characters
 
Constraint
2 ≤ length of word ≤ 100

=== Sum something (50)

Calculate the sum of an array of integers.
 
Example
numbers = [3, 13, 4, 11, 9]
 
The sum is 3 + 13 + 4 + 11 + 9 = 40.
 
Function Description 
Complete the function arraySum in the editor below.
 
arraySum has the following parameter(s):
    int numbers[n]: an array of integers
