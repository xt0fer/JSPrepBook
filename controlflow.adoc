== Control Flow

In many of these examples so far, we see a very simple *control flow*. The program starts at the first line, and just goes line by line until runs out of statements.

When programs start to get more sophisticated, the _control flow_ can be changed. There are various conditional statements, loop statements, and functions that can cause the control flow to move around within the code.
