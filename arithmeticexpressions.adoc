== JS Algebraic equations

Given a simple math equation like:
****
a = b3 - 6 

if b equals 3, then a equals ?
****

In math class, your teacher would have said "How do we solve for a?"


Best way to solve for a = b3 - 6 

is

* First (b=3) Ã— 3 = 9, then 9 - 6 = 3


=== Using JavaScript
a = b3 - 6 
[source, js]
----
let b = 3;
let a = b * 3 - 6;
console.log(a); // -> 3
----
=== Micro Lab
q = 2j + 20

if j = 5, then q = ?

Now, Your turn to solve the equation with JS


=== Solution to micro lab
q = 2j + 20

if j = 5
[source, js]
----
let q = 0; 
let j = 5;
q = 2 * j + 20;
console.log(q); // -> 30
----
=== Micro Lab
f(y) = 5y + y <sup>3</sup> - 7

if y=2, f(2) = ?

Now, Your turn to solve the equation with JS


=== Solution to micro lab
f(y) = 5y + y <sup>3</sup> - 7
[source, js]
----
let y = 2; 
y = 5 * y + Math.pow(y, 3) - 7;
console.log(y); // -> 11
----


=== Trigonometry
The word trigonometry comes from the greek word - trigonon "triangle" + metron "measure. We use trigonometry to find angles and distances

Eg: AreaOfaTriangle = height * base / 2

Therefore we just need to create variables for each and use the operators to calculate the area


=== Let's google - area of a triangle
<img width="678" height="438" data-src="areaoftriangle.png">
Let's use JavaScript to build this out!


=== Calculate Area of a Triangle in JS
Formula: A = h * b / 2
[source, js]
----
let height = 20;
let base = 10;	
let areaOfaTriangle  =  height * base / 2;
console.log(areaOfaTriangle); // -> 100
----
=== Mini Lab
Calculate the area of a circle whose radius is 7.7

Hit: You'll need to use a constant Math property


=== Calculate Area of a Circle in JS
Formula: A = Pi * r<sup>2</sup>
[source, js]
----
let radius = 7.7;	
let areaCircle  =  Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
console.log(areaCircle); // -> 186.26502843133886 (wow)
