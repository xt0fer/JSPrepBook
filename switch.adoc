=== TODO Switch Statements

Switch statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

[source, js]
----
let timeOfDay = "Afternoon";
switch(timeOfDay){
    case "Morning": 
        console.log("Time to eat breakfast");
        break;
    case "Afternoon":
        console.log("Time to eat lunch");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Time to eat dinner");
}

[TIP]
====
Write code to check if a user is old enough to drink.

- if the user is under 18. Print out cannot party with us
- Else if the user is 18 or over. Print out party over here
- Else print out. I do not recognize your age
===

You should use a switch statement. 
Finally, make sure to change the value of the age variable to output out different results.
